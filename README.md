# Notice

The component and platforms in this repository are not meant to be used by a
user, but as a "myfitnesspal" that custom component developers can build
upon, to make more awesome stuff.

This myfitnesspal uses ['sampleclient'](https://github.com/ludeeus/sampleclient) to simulate what you actually might use in your integration.

HAVE FUN! ðŸ˜Ž

## Why?

This is simple, by having custom_components look (README + structure) the same
it is easier for developers to help each other and for users to start using them.

If you are a developer and you want to add things to this "myfitnesspal" that you think more
developers will have use for, please open a PR to add it :)

4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/myfitnesspal/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
